Unstructured plaintext editing has remained the dominant mode of programming for decades, but makes it more difficult to implement editor services to aid the process. Structural editors, on the other hand, only allow valid edit states. Several structural editors, such as Scratch \cite{maloney2010scratch}, Lamdu \cite{lotem_chuchem}, and mbeddr \cite{voelter2012mbeddr}, have been proposed to improve the programming experience and introduce editor services, such as the elimination of syntax errors or graphical editing.

Hazel \cite{Hazel2022} is an experimental structural language definition and implementation that aims to solve the ``gap problem'': spatial and temporal holes that temporarily prevent code from being able to be compiled or evaluated. The structural editor is defined by a bidirectional edit calculus Hazelnut \cite{conf/popl/Hazelnut17}, which governs the structural editor and the static semantics (typing rules) of the language. The dynamic semantics (evaluation semantics) are described in Hazelnut Live \cite{conf/popl/HazelnutLive19}.

Hazel is a relatively new research effort by the University of Michigan's Future of Programming Lab (FPLab), with little effort placed on performance optimizations. This work attempts to achieve several enhancements to Hazelnut Live that will benefit the performance of evaluation and related tasks. Part of the work will be focused on transitioning the evaluation model from using substitution for variable bindings to using environments, with emphasis on evaluation of holes and postprocessing of the evaluation result to match the result from evaluation with substitution. The latter parts of this work will use the environment model of evaluation to improve the memoization of certain tasks specific to Hazel (such as hole closure numbering), and also implement the fill-and-resume performance enhancement described in \cite{conf/popl/HazelnutLive19}. The novelty of this work lies in the optimization capacity in the unique design of the Hazel language as a live programming editor with expression holes.

\section{The contribution of this work}
\label{sec:contribution}

This thesis presents several algorithms designed for Hazel's evaluation. These algorithms will be provided using the big-step inference rule notation introduced in \Cref{sec:semantics-notation}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The evaluation semantics of the Hazel language using the environment model. We aim to keep the implementation pure, introduce uniquely-numbered environments (for later use in memoization), and describe the evaluation of holes (which are unique to Hazel). We introduce the concepts of generalized closures, and the evaluation boundary.
\item Postprocessing, which is mostly memoized by environments and has the two major functions. The first is to convert the result to the equivalent result if substitution was used. The second is to number hole closure instances.
\item Fill-and-resume, as originally proposed in \cite{conf/popl/HazelnutLive19}. This algorithm is described at a high level in the original description, but an implementation was not provided. We provide a possible implementation, including an algorithm to detect a valid fill operation and advice on memoizing the resumption operation.
\end{itemize}

The performance of this work is measured primarily in terms of empirical performance gains (via evaluation-step counting and benchmarking), and discussed with respect to the theoretical performance. This proof of correctness of the algorithms was not mechanized in the Agda proof assistant as was much of the core of Hazelnut \cite{conf/popl/Hazelnut17} and Hazelnut Live \cite{conf/popl/HazelnutLive19}. Instead, we provide a series of core metatheorems describing invariants describing Hazel evaluation, and argue the correctness of these metatheorems by informal reasoning on the provided inference rules. A mechanized proof is deferred for future work.
