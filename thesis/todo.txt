- metatheorems for evaluation with environments
  - same as evaluation with substitution
  - all holes in the result exist in a closure
  - all unbound variables in the result exist in a closure
- metatheorems for postprocessing
  - (see error conditions)
  - the only thing that remains in a closure after postprocessing are holes

- CMTT interpretation of fill-and-resume
- Alternative methods of FAR re-evaluation with complications
  - Re-evaluation of all holes using HCI (complications: potential non-termination, evaluate things in unevaluated branches)
  - Evaluation on lookup (infinite recursion, may be slower than substituting beforehand)

Intersperse judgments with text, summarize them all in appendices
