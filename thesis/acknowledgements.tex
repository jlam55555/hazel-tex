Lastly, and most importantly, I thank my family, who have allowed me to spend all my efforts in school unhindered for the past eight years, even through the panic of a pandemic. I thank my parents for the immense support in this process, and my sisters Jessica, Juliet, Josie\footnote{Not human.}, Sharon$^1$, and Jane$^1$ for your emotional support. I thank the numerous family members that have allowed me to reside with them during my stay in the city: my grandma, Uncle Frank, Ben, Uncle John, and Aunt Amy. I hope I can repay your generosity someday. Lastly, I again thank my grandma for being my most lively and loving cheerleader.
