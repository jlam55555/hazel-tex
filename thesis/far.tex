\section{Implementation of fill-and-resume}
\label{sec:far_impl}

% General steps:
% Determine that the last edit action only involves changes within a hole
% - May go multiple steps back (memoization)
% Elaborate the expression to substitute in
% Determine if the synthesized type of the expression matches that of the hole (from the hole context)
% - Multiple cases here
% Evaluate each instance of the hole
% Update it in each of its parent hole closures
% Update it in the result
% Remove hole closure from HCC

% More consistent to consider the end result as contained within a top-level hole,
% as if our program were always incomplete (perhaps, philosophically)

% TODO: walk through a few examples by hand
% - Introduce new type inconsistencies
% - Remove old type inconsistencies
% - No new type (in)consistencies
% - Multiple hole instances
% - Multiple parent hole instances
