\section{Improvements to FAR}
\label{sec:far-improvements}

\todo{need general cleanup of FAR implementation, not very complete}

\todo{optimizing how many edit states to go back: tradeoffs between storage (how many edit states to store) and speed (how much execution time to detect a FAR, how expensive is FAR depending on which edit state; currently the most recent edit state is used, something like a LRU; may want to cache recent edit states that spawned a FAR or group edit states like in the undo history currently)}

\todo{automatic vs manual far detection}

\section{Mechanization of metatheorems and rules}
\label{sec:formalization}

\section{FAR for all edits}
\label{sec:far_all_edits}

% TODO: talk about structural diff-ing idea, go back to some past edit state
% in which all edits since then fall within some hole(s)

\section{Stateless and efficient notebook environment}
\label{sec:notebook_ui_future}
