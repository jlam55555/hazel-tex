\section{Related concurrent research directions in Hazel}
\label{app:contributions}

This appendix lists various subdivisions of Hazel that may be affected by the changes described in this paper

\subsection{Hole and hole instance numbering}
\label{sec:concurrent_work_numbering}

\subsubsection{Improved hole renumbering}
\label{sec:other_hole_numbering}

% Yuchen's three hole numbering improvements, which are based off of this foundation

\subsection{Performance enhancements}
\label{sec:concurrent_work_performance}

\subsubsection{Evaluation limits}
\label{sec:gas}

% gas to stop extra long-running evaluation ... does not jive well since it doesn't end up in a final expression

\subsubsection{Hazel compiler}
\label{sec:concurrent_work_compiler}

% much larger speedup for general execution (probably)
% may be beneficial to implement reified environments for compilation to a low-level form
% - read about existing work with grain/binaryen/wasm (is this considered low-level?)

\subsection{Agda Formalization}
\label{sec:concurrent_work_formalization}

% a more formal verification that the new rules satisfy the existing metatheorems related to evaluation and the theory described for fill-and-resume

%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-master: "main"
