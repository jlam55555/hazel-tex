Write-ups related to [Hazel][hazel] for M.Eng thesis

### Installation

The `latex-packages/*.sty` files need to be installed in the global `texmf` location. This can be done with the `./install_sty.sh` script.

### Style resources

The LaTeX styles are based off of the papers in the [hazelgrove][hazelgrove] organization, in particular the [POPL17 paper][popl17]. That paper in turn uses styles from [jdunfield/latex-library][latex-library] for the inference/implication notation.
